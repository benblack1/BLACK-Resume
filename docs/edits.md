## My Feeback

#### Education:

You may consider splitting the scholarship and the GPA into two separate bullet points.  Also, its not clear to me what you mean by "full academic scholarship."  Is that a 4-year scholarship?  If so, it may be worth adding that (for example, "4-Year Full Academic Scholarship")

#### Experience

I think your description of your Melaleuca work is really good.  If you could make the descriptions of your Hill Air Force Base work more specific, as you did with Melaleuca, I think it would be stronger.  "Solutions" is a pretty generic description.

Under the BYU-Idaho job, I think "an SQL..." should be "a SQL".  Otherwise, I think this whole selection looks very impressive!


#### Service and Project History - Personal Projects

You have a typo in your Brownie Points Counter "ont the".
